Proposal:

I'm going to (re)create an accountability buddy app, Consequi. I have made this app previosuly for an intensive, however, it was written in React and overall has remained unfinished. This time it will be in Django! 

This is useful to me, personally, as a portfolio item. It would also be helpful to users who need help remaining accountable.
